In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
[obj release]; // Potential memory leak here
```

The issue lies in the fact that `obj.myString` now has a retain count of 2 (one from `alloc` and one from assigning to `myString`).  When `obj` is released, the retain count goes to 1, but `myString` still retains a reference to the memory allocated for "Hello". This will not be released unless explicitly released after assignment, potentially leading to a memory leak.  If the object was autoreleased, it would be more complex yet still problematic.
